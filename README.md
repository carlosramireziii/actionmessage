# ActionMessage

This is a pet project â€“ a microset of ActionMailer for working with SMS messages.
Pull requests are more than welcome!

## Usage

Install it using bundler

```
# Gemfile
gem 'actionmessage'
```

or just require it:

```
gem install actionmessage
require 'action_message'
```

```ruby
# If you're using Rails, place this on your environment file or application.rb
ActionMessage::Base.default_options = {
	from: "number to send from in international format, e.g.: +11231231234", 
	adapter: { 
		name: :twilio,
		credentials: {
			account_sid: 'MY TWILIO ACCOUNT SID'.freeze,
			auth_token: 'MY AUTH TOKEN'.freeze
		}
	}
}

# Put this for example, under app/messages/merchant_message.rb

class MerchantMessage < ActionMessage::Base
	def send_welcome_sms(name)
		@name = name
		sms(to: "+5531982726767")
	end
end

# Define your views under app/views/merchant_message/send_welcome_sms.text.erb
Welcome, <%= @name %>!!!
```
